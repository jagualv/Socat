# socat

**Flexible data relay for advanced networking solutions**

***

## Overview

**socat** is a powerful tool that enables bidirectional data transfer between two independent data channels. Each channel can be a file, pipe, device, serial line (tty), pseudo terminal, UNIX or IPv4/IPv6 socket (including raw, UDP, TCP, SSL), proxy connection, file descriptor, program, GNU readline, or various combinations. This versatility makes socat ideal for network diagnostics, port forwarding, automation, and more.[1]

***

## Key Features

- Bidirectional relay between any supported endpoints
- Supports files, sockets (UNIX, IPv4/IPv6, TCP, UDP, SSL), pipes, pseudo-terminals
- Comprehensive set of options for tuning behavior (permissions, socket options, debug/tracing, etc.)
- Serves as:
  - TCP port forwarder (single-run or daemon)
  - External socksifier and firewall tester
  - Shell interface to sockets
  - Serial-to-network relay
  - Secure chroot/su network script environment
- Advanced features: listening sockets, named pipes, daemon mode, logging, process forking, and stream processing.[1]

***

## Platform Support

socat is cross-platform and known to compile and run on:
- **Linux** (multiple distributions and versions)
- **FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD**
- **OpenSolaris, Solaris**
- **Mac OS X**
- **AIX, HP-UX, Tru64**
- **Cygwin (Windows compatibility layer)**
- Other UNIX-like systems may also work.[1]

## Installation

### From Source

1. **Download and extract:**
   ```sh
   tar xzf socat.tar.gz
   cd socat-<version>
   ```

2. **Configure, build, and install:**
   ```sh
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   ```
   This installs `socat`, `filan`, and `procan` in `/usr/local/bin` by default.[1]

3. **Compiler:**  
   GCC or EGC is recommended. Use the provided Makefiles if GCC is unavailable.

### Binary Packages

- Check the project's official homepage for prebuilt binaries that match common platforms. This is often the simplest install option for most users.[1]

***

## Platform-Specific Notes

- **RedHat:** Install development headers for tcpwrappers, readline, and OpenSSL before building.
- **AIX & HP-UX:** Some manual configuration and environment variables may be needed; see README for system-specific advice.
- **Solaris & others:** Ensure library directories are in the loader path.[1]
